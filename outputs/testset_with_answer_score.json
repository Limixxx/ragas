Introduction\nSentiment analysis has been an established area\nofresearch innatural language processing (NLP)\nthat studies people’s sentiments, opinions,\nemotions, etc. through computational\nmethods[4][7].Thisfieldhasgainedsignifi-cant\ninterestinbothacademia andindustryfieldsdue\nto its useful applications in analyzing customer\nfeedback,decision-making,andproductcreation.\nSentiment classification can be defined as the\nprocedure of assigning predetermined sentiment\nclasses (positive, negative) depending on the\nemotional tone of a message through analyzing\ntext. In NLP this task is widely used to\ndetermine the polarity of opinions expressed in\ntext. In recent years, large language models\n(LLMs)havebeenpopularinvariousNLPtasks,\nand a deeper understanding of human emotions\nthrough sentiment classification is an important\nstepping stone towards developing artificial\nintelligence[1]\nRecent work shows that models such as BERT\n[2] and LLaMA [11] perform well in general\nsentiment analysis tasks but still struggle with\nnuancedorstructuredsentimenttasks,especially\nwhen more refined emotional or opinion-based\ndistinctions are required [9]. Despite\nadvancements in LLMs, there are challenges in\napplying them to complex sentiment tasks,\nincluding identifying subtle emotions and\nhandling domain-specific contexts [5, 7]. We\npropose comparing the fine-tuned DistilBERT\nand LLaMA 3 models, evaluating their\nperformance on datasets for sentiment analysis.\nDistilBERT offers computational efficiency,\nwhile LLaMA 3 leverages a larger architecture\nfor complex tasks. This allows for a practical\nassessmentoftrade-offsbetweenmodelsizeand\nperformance.This paper compares the\nperformance of DistilBERT and LLaMA 3 in\nsentiment analysis using few-shot training. We\nfine-tune both models on domain-specific\ndatasets, including the IMDB Kaggle movie\nreview dataset. In this research, we fine-tune\nboth models, asking them to classify reviews as\npositive or negative. We test both models in\nzero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios to evaluate\ntheirgeneralizationacrossdifferentdomains.\n"
